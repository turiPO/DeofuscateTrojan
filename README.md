# Deofucate VBScript Trojan
Deofuscated VBScript virus I found in 2015 in a famous website. In this repo I disclosured this virus for the first time and publish what it does.
It was a potential risk for many people and there was only single anti-virus which alerted from it.

Since 2017 most of the anti-virus softwares started to alert from it, so today in >=2022 it may be helpul for educational purposes.
